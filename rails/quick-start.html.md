In this guide we'll develop and deploy a Rails application that first
demonstrates a trivial view, then scaffolds a database table, and finally makes
use of [Turbo Streams](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/streams) to dynamically
update pages.

In order to start working with Fly you will need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps on Fly. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/). Once thats installed you'll want to [log in to Fly](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).

<!--
Once you have logged on, here are the three steps and a recap.  Proceed with the first one, then on to the next.

One you have logged on, the first step starts with [Add a Bit of Splash](/docs/rails/quick-start/splash/).
