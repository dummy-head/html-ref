[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), or PostgreSQL, is a powerful open-source object relational database system.

Fly Postgres runs as a Fly.io app, with an automated creation process and flyctl integration to simplify management. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fly-apps/postgres-ha) to view and fork.
