Getting an application running on Fly is essentially working out how to package it as a deployable image<%- if defined?(database) %> and attach it to a database<%- end %>.
Once packaged it can be deployed to the Fly infrastructure to run on the global application platform.

For this _Getting Started_ article, we'll look at deploying <%= "#{runtime.downcase.start_with?(/[aeiou]/) ? "an" : "a"} #{runtime}" %>
<%= defined?(type) ? type : "application" %>
on Fly<%- if defined?(database) %> and connecting it to a PostgreSQL database<%- end %>.
