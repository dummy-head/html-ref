The quickest way to connect to your deployed app is with the `fly open` command. This will open a browser on the http version of the site. That will automatically be upgraded to a https secured connection (when using the fly.dev domain) to connect to it securely. Add `/name` to `fly open` and it'll be appended to the apps path and you'll get an extra greeting from the hellofly application.

```cmd
fly open /fred
```
```out
Opening http://hellofly.fly.dev/fred
```
