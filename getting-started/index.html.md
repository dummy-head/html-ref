This section of the Fly.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

If youâ€™re new to Fly.io, our [Hands-on section](/docs/hands-on/) will take you through creating an account, installing `flyctl`, the Fly.io command-line tool, and launching a simple demo app.

Once that's done, you can dive straight in and check out our [Language & Frameworks Guides](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/) for a demonstration matching your project, or stick around for a tour through the commands you'll need to work with Fly Apps through their entire lifecycle, and a troubleshooting section for those occasional moments when things don't go as expected.

* [Working with Fly Apps](/docs/getting-started/working-with-fly-apps/) covers
  * Finding out about your app - the `info` and `status` commands
  * Viewing app logs
  * Managing secrets for an app
  * Adding hostnames and creating certificates
* [Troubleshooting Deployments](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/) covers
  * Port settings and checking them
  * Reviewing deployment logs
  * Checking your app's host binding


We also have some [web-based launchers](https://fly.io/launch/), including [Turboku](https://fly.io/launch/heroku); a way to dip your toes in by cloning a Heroku app to Fly.io. Read about it in the [New Turboku launch post](https://fly.io/blog/new-turboku/).
