## _The HelloStatic Site_

Our example will be a be hosting a HTML file. There's no need for any tools. Feel free to add in any HTML files you'd like to serve too.

Either use an existing directory with an `index.html`, or clone our example from [the hellostatic Github repository](https://github.com/fly-apps/hello-static). Just `git clone https://github.com/fly-apps/hello-static` to get a local copy. Here's all the code for our `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Hello from Fly
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Fly with a static web site</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## _Install Flyctl and Login_

We are ready to start working with Fly and that means we need `flyctl`, our CLI app for managing apps on Fly. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/). Once that's installed you'll want to [log in to Fly](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).

## _Configuring the App for Fly_

Each Fly application needs a `fly.toml` file to tell the system how we'd like to deploy it. The `fly.toml` can be automatically generated with `flyctl launch`.

```cmd
flyctl launch
```
```output
Creating app in /apps/hello-static
Scanning source code
Detected a Static app
? App Name (leave blank to use an auto-generated name):
? Select organization: flyorg (flyorg)
? Select region: lax (Los Angeles, California (US))
Created app hellostatic in organization flyorg
Wrote config file fly.toml
? Would you like to deploy now? Yes
```

Next you'll be prompted for an organization. Organizations are a way of sharing applications between Fly users. When you are asked to select an organization, there should be one with your account name; this is your personal organization. Select that.

## _Viewing your static site_

The quickest way to browse your newly deployed application is with the `flyctl open` command.

```cmd
flyctl open
```
```output
Opening http://hellostatic.fly.dev/
```
