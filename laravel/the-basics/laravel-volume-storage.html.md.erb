objective: Mount a volume to a re-initialized storage folder

The [storage folder](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/filesystem#the-local-driver) by default, holds several "generated" essentials of your Laravel application. 

It's the default burrow for session, cache, and file data amongst others. If you'd opt to persist data on this folder, you'll have to mount a [volume](/docs/reference/volumes/) to it.


## The Steps

<%= partial "docs/laravel/partials/volume_storage_steps" %>

<b>On to the content of the Start Up script:</b>

```bash
FOLDER=/var/www/html/storage/app
if [ ! -d "$FOLDER" ]; then
    echo "$FOLDER is not a directory, copying storage_ content to storage"
    cp -r /var/www/html/storage_/. /var/www/html/storage
    echo "deleting storage_..."
    rm -rf /var/www/html/storage_
fi
```

<small>
So what happened above?
- The condition statement checks if the app folder does not exist in the volumized storage folder. If it does not exist, it copies over the contents of the storage_ folder to the volumized storage folder.

<b>Finally, deploy your Laravel Fly App!</b>

```cmd
fly deploy
```
