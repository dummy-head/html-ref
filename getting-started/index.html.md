This section of the Fly.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

If youâ€™re new to Fly.io, our [Hands-on](/docs/hands-on/) will take you through creating an account, installing `flyctl`, the Fly.io command-line tool, and launching a simple demo app.

Once that's done, you can dive straight in and check out our [Language & Frameworks Guides](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/) for a demonstration matching your project.

Or get into the details you'll need to work with Fly Apps through their entire lifecycle in the [Fly Apps](/docs/apps/) section.

We also have some [web-based launchers](https://fly.io/launch/), including [Turboku](https://fly.io/launch/heroku); a way to dip your toes in by cloning a Heroku app to Fly.io. Read about it in the [New Turboku launch post](https://fly.io/blog/new-turboku/).
