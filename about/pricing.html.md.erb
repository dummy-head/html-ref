Our pricing is designed to let you run small applications for free, and scale costs affordably as your needs grow.

Fly.io services are billed per organization. Billing is based on the resources provisioned for your app, prorated for the time they are up.

Each organization includes enough usage to run small apps. Resources included for free:

* Up to 3 shared-cpu-1x 256mb VMs
* 3GB persistent volume storage (total) 
* 160GB outbound data transfer

Additional resources are billed at the usage-based pricing detailed below.
