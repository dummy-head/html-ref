## What is Launch On Fly?

Launch On Fly lets you select pre-defined configurations of popular applications for automatic deployment on your Fly account. All you need to do is give your new app a name, pick what resources you'd like the app to have, and say which region you'd like it to run in and Fly does the rest.
