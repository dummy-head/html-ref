Welcome to the Fly Documentation. There's a lot here so we have guides to speed you to the information you need.

## _In the Overview_

This is the Overview section. Here you will find:

* **Introduction**: The [Introduction](/docs/introduction/) explains what Fly is, why we built it and what it can do for you.
* **Speedrun**: The [Speedrun](/docs/speedrun/) is the bare essentials of deploying an App on Fly in the fewest possible steps.
* **Hands-on**: The [Hands-on Section](/docs/hands-on/start/) is a more leisurely step-by-step introduction to the same process: deploying an App on Fly.

Beyond the Overview section, there are four major sections of the documentation.

## _Quickstart Guides_

The [Quickstart guides](/docs/getting-started/) go deeper into building and deploying apps on Fly, including specific guides for Go, Node, Ruby and Deno, and creating a static website. There's also a quick guide on how to work with your deployed Apps.

## _Guides and Examples_

Our [Guides and Examples Section](/docs/guides/) is a library of both full examples and detailed guides on how to configure and run particular apps or use Fly for specific applications.

## _Fly Reference_

The [Reference section](/docs/reference/) is the heart of the documentation with both essential reference content for Fly's command-line tool [Flyctl](/docs/flyctl/) and reference material for everything from Fly's architecture and scaling to Redis on Fly and managing secrets.

## _About Fly_

The [About section](/docs/about/) has all the essential things you need to know about Fly as a service: pricing, security, support, privacy, and terms.
