Fly application services are billed individually based on usage. Most services include a free tier â€“ enough for you to run smaller applications at no cost (and when they grow, very little cost). Billing is per user or organization, if you want to run more free apps, just make another organization and invite your friends.

## _Free tier_

</div>

## _Compute_

##### Virtual Machines

<%= partial("shared/cpu_mem_pricing") %>

##### Persistent Volumes

You can add one or more persistent volumes to your apps with `flyctl volumes create ...`:

* $0.15/GB per month of provisioned capacity

Volume billing is pro-rated to the hour.

## _Network prices_

##### Anycast IP addresses

Each application includes one Anycast IPv4 and unlimited Anycast IPv6 Anycast addresses for global load balancing. Additional IPv4 addresses are $2/mo.

##### Managed SSL certificates

We use Lets Encrypt to issue certificates, and donate half of our SSL fees to them at the end of each calendar year.

* Single hostname certificates
  * Free for the first 10
  * $0.10/mo for additional certificates
* Wildcard certificates: $2/mo

##### PostgreSQL Clusters

The `fly pg create` command will install a PostgreSQL cluster in your organization. PostgreSQL clusters are just "apps" made up of VMs, persistent volumes, and (possibly) extra memory. We bill only for the resources PostgreSQL clusters use.
