Now the application has been deployed, let's find out more about its deployment. The command `fly status` will give you the basic details.

```cmd
fly status
```
```out
App
  Name     = hellofly          
  Owner    = personal       
  Hostname = hellofly.fly.dev  
  Platform = machines       

ID              STATE   REGION  HEALTH CHECKS           IMAGE                   CREATED              UPDATED              
e78492ecee0d83  started iad     1 total, 1 passing      flyio/hellofly:latest   2023-01-22T03:32:52Z 2023-01-22T03:32:53Z
```

In this example, the application has been deployed with a DNS hostname of `hellofly.fly.dev`. Your deployment's name will, of course, be different. We can also see that the app has a single VM running in the iad (Virginia) region.
