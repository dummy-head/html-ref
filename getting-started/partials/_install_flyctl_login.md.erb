## _Install `flyctl` and login_

We have a [CLI](/docs/flyctl/) tool for deploying and managing Fly applications.  If you're on a Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```cmd
brew install superfly/tap/flyctl
```

On macOS without Homebrew or Linux you can run the install script

```cmd
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

Windows has its own Powershell install script that you can run

```cmd
iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
