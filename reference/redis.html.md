[Upstash Redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis) is a fully-managed, Redis-compatible database with global read replica support. Upstash integrates deeply with Fly. Databases are provisioned on Fly infrastructure, available to your Fly organization on a private IPv6 address.

You can provision and manage Upstash databases with the commands under `flyctl redis`.
